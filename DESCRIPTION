Description: Contains procedures for maximization of likelihoods of a quantitative model for DNA mixtures (STR) for a general specifications of hypotheses. It also contains procedures for estimating the profiles of unknown contributors (deconvolution). The implemented model takes care of drop-out, drop-in, degradation and stutters (both backward and forward).
